# Idris-Number-Theory
Elementary number theory written in Idris.

Final Goal - To write a gcd function which gives the gcd of two numbers along with the proof that it is indeed the gcd.
Next step - 1. To have a rigorous definition of positive natural numbers and rewrite the properties of divisiblity
            ( Defining is done, rewrting is ongoing)
            2. To create a separate file containing useful equalities to manipulate natural numbers
