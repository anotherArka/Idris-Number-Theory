# Idris-Number-Theory
Elementary number theory written in Idris.

Final Goal - To write a gcd function which gives the gcd of two numbers along with the proof that it is indeed the gcd.
Next step - 1. To identify several important properties of natural numbers and prove them in idris
            2. To create a separate file containing useful equalities to manipulate natural numbers

logical implications - some logical relations which are provable in type theory

distributiveMultAdd - Prooves of distributive laws.

associativeMult - Proof that mult is associative.

commutativeMult - Proof that mult is commutative.

properties_of_divisibility - basic properties of divisibility

properties_of_divisibility_1 - some more properties of divisibility

trial_and_error - trying to define division algorithm. Commented part of the code is taking too long to compile.
