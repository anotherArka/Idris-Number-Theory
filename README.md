# Idris-Number-Theory
Elementary number theory written in Idris.

Final Goal - To write a gcd function which gives the gcd of two numbers along with the proof that it is indeed the gcd.
Next step - 1. To identify several important properties of natural numbers and prove them in idris
            2. To create a separate file containing useful equalities to manipulate natural numbers
            3. Find a total definition of Gcd

myGcd- Trying to give a total definition of Gcd which gives the gcd of two numbers along with the proof that the result is correct. I have given one definition using Euclid's algorithm which Idris is not accepting as total.
