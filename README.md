# Idris-Number-Theory
Elementary number theory written in Idris.

Final Goal - To write a gcd function which gives the gcd of two numbers along with the proof that it is indeed the gcd.

Next step - 1. To identify several important properties of natural numbers and prove them in idris

            2. To create a separate file containing useful equalities to manipulate natural number
            
            3. Tidy things up to make it more readable
            
            

--Modules

logical implications - some logical relations which are provable in type theory

properties_of_Nat - basic properties of natural number

properties_of_order - basic properties of the order on natural numbers

properties_of_positive_Nat - Definition and properties of positive natural numbers

associativePlus - Proof that plus is associative.

commutativePlus - Proof that plus is commutative.

distributiveMultAdd - Prooves of distributive laws.

associativeMult - Proof that mult is associative.

commutativeMult - Proof that mult is commutative.

properties_of_divisibility - basic properties of divisibility

coProductType - definition of coProductType

congruence - my definition of congruence. Which is just an explicit version of cong in idris

difference - definition of difference between two natural numbers along with useful properties

total_Gcd - a total definition of the Gcd function which just gives the gcd of two natural numbers.

myGcd- Total definition of Gcd which gives the gcd of two numbers along with the proof that the result is correct.
